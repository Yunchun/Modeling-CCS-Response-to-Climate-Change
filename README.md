# 2019 CCE LTER REU Project Overview
I worked with Lawrence Balitaan and Dr. Art Miller, under the mentorship of PhD candidate Nathali Cordero-Quirós, to study how physical and biological variables of the ocean interact and respond to climate change. In the process, I used MATLAB to make time series that present ecosystem model data over depth of the California Current System (CCS). Then, I created correlation maps and composite plots of CCS during El Niño and La Niña events. Moreover, I conducted bootstrap test to identify significant marine variables anomalies at a 90% significance level. Using these plots, I analyzed each oceanic variable both individually and collectively to discover and characterize trends. This project is awarded with Winter 2020 Triton Research and Experiential Learning Scholarship.
